# cs-assignment7
This repo is an assignment for a course in c# at Malm√∂ University. This was an optional assignment for those who aimed for top grades.
The project resulted in an app used at work to get random students to answer questions during class.<br>
Grade recieved: A<br>
In order to run the application follow these steps:<br>
1. Click "code" and "download zip"
2. Unzip the folder
3. In the folder locate the folder called "bin"
4. Then the folder "Debug" (you should only have one option here)
5. Continue until you find the file "Assignment7.exe" and click it<br>
The application should now start (on windows, may not work as intended on macIos)
